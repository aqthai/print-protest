        <h1>Print & Protest</h1>
        <p>Welcome to my portfolio.  Below are the first prints I made with a letterpress.</p>

        <h1>Alvin - Rehired</h1>
        <p>This is my name with a catchphrase.  It was made with the intent of renewing myself in the workplace.</p>

        <h1>Your assignment</h1>
        <p>With my occupation as tutor in mind, my group agreed to collaborate with me on this.</p>

        <h1>Immerse in Biodiversity</h1>
        <p>Part of why I made this is to express gratitude for being in schoo- I mean a place of diverse experiences.</p>

        <h1>Taking Responsibility</h1>
        <p>This expresses one of my values.  Being accountable of my work is what lets me sleep at night.  This is a response to Harryette Mullen's "We are not responsible", a poem that attacks connotations of having a job.</p>

        <h1>adaptAdaptAdapt</h1>
        <p>After reading a poem by Harryette Mullen and researching general health trends, I printed "Adapt with forest", "Adapt with body", and "Adaptive Immunity" while gradually changing font size to match the scale of each phrase.  The words that become inconvenient to read express my relationship with those matters.</p>

        <h1>Work When Asked</h1>
        <p>This letterpress protests an industrialization for excessive service.  It applies to oil pipelines built on Standing Rock, but had me questioning work and home life boundaries.</p>

        <h1>Indians and Capitalists</h1>
        <p>This print has a graphic pressed through a thin screen coated with emulsion.  The same method is used for print on clothing.  I got to squeegee this one only.</p>
        <img src="indiansAndCapitalists.JPG" alt="">
        <p>My attempt at coating and washing off emulsion was done by using the transparency below.  It's a print with Python turtle.  In retrospect, lines have to be dense enough to block light from the UV exposure machine.</p>
